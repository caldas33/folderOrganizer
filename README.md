## Python Folder Organizer

This script is useful if you are trying to organize your files in folders related to the file types.
The script contains an enum with all of the recognized file types - if the wanted type is not defined there, then the file will be moved to a misc directory.

### Possible next steps:
1. Making the script automated - to be ran when any download is made
2. Allow the script to be ran in all of the directories selected (or even all the directories from a root directory in the computer)
